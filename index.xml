      <description>curriculum development I have co-developed a set of resources to support teaching sustainability, equity, and anti-racism in undergraduate civil engineering curriculum. These resources are available on the &amp;ldquo;Learn and Teach Green, People-Centered Civil Engeering website (website geo-restricted to Canada, contact me for access while we work to remove the institutional geo-restriction). lectures I have been invited to give a number of guest lectures and public talks, including:
Global Groundwater Group, The Nature Conservancy (USA) University of Mainz + International Centre for Water Resources and Global Change (Germany) Water and Development Research Group, Aalto University (Finland) Biodiversity and Natural Resources Research Program, IIASA (Austria) Water Security Research Group, IIASA (Austria) POLIS Water Sustainability Project Water Research Roundup Series [video] Arizona State University&amp;rsquo;s SOS 598: Pathways to Global Groundwater Sustainability UVic&amp;rsquo;s CIVE 445/545: Groundwater Hydrology UVic&amp;rsquo;s CIVE 400: Cross Disciplinary Capstone Design Project teaching assistant roles I have lectured, taught labs, and performed other teaching assistant roles in the following courses:</description>
